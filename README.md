# Exercise 5.10 (Rounding Numbers)
An application of function ceil is rounding a value to the nearest integer. 

The statement;
- y = ceil (x + .5);

round the number to the nearest integer and assign the result to y. Write a program that reads several numbers and uses the preceeding statement to round each of these numbers to the integer. For each number processed, print both the original number and the rounded number.

# Exercise 4.18 - Bar-Chart Printing Program
One interesting application of computers is drawing graphs and bar charts. Write a program that reads five numbers (each between 1 and 30). For each number read, your program should print a line containing that number of adjacent asterisks. For example, if your program reads the number seven, it should print *******.

# Exercise 4.19 - Calculating Sales
An online retailer sells five products whose retail prices are shown in the following table:

| Product Number| Retail Prices |
| :------------ | :------------:| 
| 1             | $2.98         |
| 2             | $4.50         |  
| 3             | $9.98         | 
| 4             | $4.49         |
| 5             | $6.87         |

- Write a program that reads a series of pairs of numbers as follows:
    - Product number
    - Quantity sold for one day
    
Your program should use a switch statement to help determine the retail price for each product.

Your program should calculate and display the total retail value of all products sold lastweek.
